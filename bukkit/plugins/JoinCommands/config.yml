# Default Configuration for Join Commands Spigot
# Made by SirBlobman for v${plugin.version}

# Start Spigot Options
# These options are only used on the server
spigot-options:
  # Does JoinCommands need to hook into BungeeCord?
  # This requires you to install JoinCommands on the BungeeCord proxy as well.
  bungeecord-hook: false

# This is a set of commands that will be executed when a player joins the spigot server.
server-join-commands:
  # 'exampleOne' is the command ID. This can be any valid YML section string, but they must all be different
  #exampleOne:
    # This is the list of commands that will be executed if the conditions are matched.
    #
    # Valid Placeholders:
    # - {player} - The name of the player that joined
    #
    # Valid Prefixes:
    # - no prefix - Execute the command as console (e.g. "eco give {player} 100")
    # - [PLAYER] - Execute the command as a player (e.g. "[PLAYER]kit tools")
    # - [OP] - Execute the command as the player, but with OP permissions (e.g. "[OP]warp opsOnlyArea")
    # - [BPLAYER] - Execute the command as the player, but through the BungeeCord Proxy (requires 'bungeecord-hook' to be true and the proxy to be setup properly)
    # - [BCONSOLE] - Execute the command as the BungeeCord Proxy console (requires 'bungeecord-hook' to be true and the proxy to be setup properly)
    #command-list:
    #  - "msg {player} Hello!"
    #  - "say {player} joined the server!"

    # What permission does the player need to have before this command to be executed?
    # Leave it blank for no permission check
    # This is not the permission for the 'command-list'

    # How long should JoinCommands wait (in ticks) to execute the command list?
    # 20 ticks = 1 second
