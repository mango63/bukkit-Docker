#                       Welcome to the main configuration of ChatControl

#
#    For support and documentation, please visit:
#    - https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Red/wiki
#
# !-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
#
#    1) COLOR CODES are supported with the '&' character.
#       - For usage, see http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Formatting_codes
#       - When you use them, place quotes around the message like this: "Hello &cworld."
#       - To use HEX colors, use #123456 syntax: "Hello #123456world."
#
#    2) TO HIDE any message, set it to 'none'.
#
#    3) For UNICODE CHARACTERS (smileys, symbols, ..), save the file in UTF-8 encoding. See
#       - https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Red/wiki/Use-Right-Encoding
#
#    4) JSON is supported.
#       - For usage, see https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Red/wiki/JSON
#
#    5) WHITELISTS can be turned into blacklists, by putting "@blacklist" on the first line.
#       - Doing such, filters will only apply for messages in those lists.
#
#    PS: Everything above applies for all files in ChatControl/ folder.

  # Channels are preconfigured public chat rooms where players can message each other.
  # You can add various keys and remove those you don't use, see this tutorial:
  # https://github.com/kangarko/chatcontrol-Red/wiki/Channels
  #
  # Channel options:
  #
  # - Format: The only mandatory option. Represents the style of the message 
  #           when sent into the channel. Either type the format directly such as 
  #           "{player}: {message}" there, or type the name of a Format from your formats/ folder,
  #           such as "chat" if your format file is called chat.yml. Formats can have fancy
  #           hoverable and clickable parts.
  #
  # - Format_Console: Overrides the console format from above. Set to "none" to hide or "default"
  #                   to use channel's formatting.
  #                   Warning: The only way to hide console log is to cancel the event, which may
  #                   conflict with DynMap or other plugins. Be careful hiding this!
  #
  # - Format_Discord: Overrides the discord format from above. To disable, do NOT use the Discord
  #                   option and we simply won't send messages to Discord.
  #
  # - Format_Spy: Overrides the spy format from the "Spy" section below. Set to "none" to hide.
  #
  # - Range: How far in blocks around player should others see the message?
  #          To make the range per-world, set it to "*", otherwise set it to a number
  #          such as "50" that would be 50 blocks around the sender.
  #          Staff with chatcontrol.bypass.range permission will reach everyone on all worlds.
  #          Players with chatcontrol.bypass.range.world will reach everyone on the same world
  #          and linked worlds.
  #
  # - Range_Worlds: If "Range" is set to "*", which means everyone on world sees the message,
  #                 this is a list of worlds that are connected where players chat together.
  # 
  # - Party: Makes the channel players only reach other players in the same party. This can work
  #          together with Range, but does not require that option. 
  #          Available values: factions-faction, plotsquared-plot, towny-town, towny-nation,
  #          mcmmo-party, towny-ally and lands-land
  #          Warning: The Party option does not work over BungeeCord!
  #
  # - Message_Delay: This overrides Anti_Spam.Chat.Delay so you can chat chat delay per channel.
  #                  Put string values there like "5 seconds" or "1 minute" etc.
  #
  # - Bungee: true/false option. This overrides Integration.BungeeCord from below, so you can
  #           disable BungeeCord message synchronization for some channels.
  #
  # - Discord: true/false/string option. 
  #            true = connect with discord as per our integration guide:
  #            https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Red/wiki/Discord
  #            false = do not connect with discord
  #            string = connect with the given discord channel name (see link above) 
  #
  # - Cancel_Event: true/false option. Set to true if you want this channel to be hidden from DynMap
  #                 or other plugins. You may need adjusting this: 
  #                 https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Red/wiki/Listener-Priorities
