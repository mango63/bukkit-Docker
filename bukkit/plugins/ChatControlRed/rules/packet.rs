# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file applies to all messages sent from the server to the player. That way, you can
# filter ANY message, including those from other plugins or the server itself.
#
# There are limitations to this, such as all hover/click events will get removed if you 
# want to change the message.
#
# *Important* This file EXCLUDES global rules and it is highly recommended not to import them
# due to server crashes and players being kicked out/crashed. Packets are dangerous territory.
#
# You need ProtocolLib to use packet rules.
#
# For help, see the header in the global.rs file.
