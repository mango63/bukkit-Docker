# Prevent some abused game commands.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Prevent /op command but ignore other commands by ending the message with \b.
# This makes the filter match /op but not /open. The \b means basically a space after the word.
match ^\/op\b
ignore perm chatcontrol.bypass.rules
name /op
then warn {prefix_success}Yes, we are giving away OPs. Seriously, what did you expect?!
then notify chatcontrol.notify.rulesalert &8[&7ID {rule_name}&8] &7{player}: &f{original_message}
then deny

# Prevent /gm and /gamemode command without permission, replacing error with a funny message.
match ^\/(gm|gamemode)\b
ignore perm essentials.gamemode
name /gm
then warn {prefix_success}That would be nice, wouldn't it?
then notify chatcontrol.notify.rulesalert &8[&7ID {rule_name}&8] &7{player}: &f{original_message}
then deny

match ^\/heal\b
ignore perm essentials.heal
then warn {prefix_question}Game too hard for ya?
then deny

match ^\/trade\b
ignore gamemode survival
then warn {prefix_error}Nah, you cannot trade your hard earned creative diamonds fool!
then deny

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You can even disable some of our in-built commands using rules such as conversion mode in PMs.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Prevents users from enabling conversation mode
#match ^\/(tell|w|m|t|pm|message|msg|whisper) ([a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,16})$
#then warn &cUsage: /$1 (username) (message)
#then deny

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create "/admin toggle" command that switches player from writing in admin and standard channel.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This rule only executes when player is not in the admin channel for reading.
#match ^(\/admin toggle)
#dont verbose
#ignore channel admin write
#then command channel join admin write
#then deny

# This rule only executes when player is in the admin channel for writing.
#match ^(\/admin toggle)
#dont verbose
#require channel admin write
#then command channel join standard write
#then deny

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a /helpop command that sends messages to a channel.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Catch "/helpop" command and send usage.
#match ^\/helpop$
#dont verbose
#then warn &cDescription: Send a message to online staff members.
#then warn &cUsage: /helpop <message>
#then deny

# Catch "/helpop <message>" and redirect to the helpop channel.
#match ^(\/helpop) (.*)
#dont verbose
#then command channel send helpop $2
#then deny
 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a /nick command that executes a longer /tag nick command.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create a simple alias for /tag nick to just type /nick instead, using two rules.
# This rule only sends the usage message, and the rule below actually forwards the command.
#match ^\/nick$
#require perm nick.set.own &cInsufficient permission ({permission}).
#then warn &cDescription: Sets your own nickname.
#then warn &cUsage: /nick <nick>
#then deny

# An example used for /nick command alias with the help of group matching (see the $2), it will
# replace what players type in /nick - that is pulled from the (.*) part
#match ^\/nick (.*)
#require perm nick.set.own &cInsufficient permission ({permission}).
#then command tag nick $1
#then deny

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create new commands and educate players.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Prevent sending mails directly to staff members and forward them to appropriate channel.
# This obviously requires you having /helpop system, it will not work if you don't have one.
# TIP: You can use channels to create a helpop channel, and create a rule that forwards
# all /helpop messages into such channel, all using just ChatControl. 
#match ^\/mail send (kangarko|anotheradmin)\b
#then warn {prefix_warn}Please use &c/helpop&6 to contact our staff.
#then deny

# Typing /help will call the "help" format showing players your help.
# You can also match multiple pages of help by creating multiple rules such as ^/help 2$
# and formats such as help-2 and design your entire help system using ChatControl! 
#match ^\/help$
#then warn help
#then deny

# You can create new in-game commands such as /ping that is using a custom ping variable
# from the /variables folder.
#match ^\/ping$
#then warn {prefix_info}Your ping is: {ping}ms
#then deny

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example usage of group matching.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Regular expression will make multiple group matches, in this case
# (prefix) is $1 (first) and (.*) is $2 (second)
# You can refer to them in the messages.
# NOTICE: YOU CAN ALSO USE CHATCONTROL'S TAG SYSTEM TO SET A PREFIX VIA /TAG
#match ^\/(prefix) (.*)
#require perm prefix.set.own &cInsufficient permission to change prefix. ({permission})
#then console pex user {player} prefix $2
#then warn Your prefix is now: $2
#then deny
